body: "Hi $first_name,
  
  We’ve built a free product that enables you to monetize support requests for $github_project_name (and all your other repos). The basic idea is that you can set up a profile at 21.co and use it to generate revenue for feature requests and support inquiries. Other prominent developers like $alternate_dev_name have already started experimenting with this — see 21.co/$alternate_dev_21_profile.
  
  If you'd rather donate your earnings, users can contribute their earnings to charities. Please let us know if you have any feedback or feature requests!
