  "Hi $first_name,

  My name is Balaji Srinivasan, CEO of 21. We’ve built a free product that enables you to monetize support requests for $github_project_name (and all your other repos). The basic idea is that you can set up a profile at 21.co and use it to generate revenue for feature requests and support inquiries. Other prominent developers like $alternate_dev_name have already started experimenting with this — see 21.co/$alternate_dev_21_profile.

  Please let us know if you have any feedback or feature requests. We'll be happy to assist you in setting up your a 21.co profile.
